            govern your access to use (i) Superkicks’s website
            www.Superkicks.in, and its mobile and tablet applications
            (“Platforms”), (iii) Superkicks’s online lifestyle, fashion and
            electronics solutions, which inter alia facilitates sale and
            purchase of electronics, and lifestyle and fashion merchandise
            (“Products”) through the Platforms, and (iv) the purchase of
            Products, and any other service that may be provided by Superkicks
            from time to time (collectively referred to as the “Services”).
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>1.2.</b> You hereby understand and agree that the Agreement forms
            a binding contract between Superkicks and anyone who accesses,
            browses, or purchases the Products and uses the Services in any
            manner (“User”) and accordingly, you hereby agree to be bound by the
            terms contained in the Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms
            contained in the Agreement, you are advised not to proceed with
            purchasing the Products or using the Services. The terms contained
            in the Agreement shall be accepted without modification. The use of
            the Services would constitute acceptance of the terms of the
            Agreement.

            <b>2.1.</b> Users must be 18 years of age or older to register, or
            visit or use the Services in any manner. By registering, visiting or

            that you are 18 years of age or older, and that you have the right,
            authority and capacity to use the Services, and agree to abide by
            the Agreement. If a User is below 18 years of age, it is assumed

            of his/ her parent or legal guardian and that such User’s parent or
            legal guardian has read and agrees to the terms of this Agreement,
            including terms of purchase of Products, on behalf of the minor
            User. Should Superkicks be made aware that a User is under the age
            of 18 and is using/ browsing the Platforms without the supervision
            of his/ her parent or legal guardian, Superkicks reserves the right
            to deactivate such User’s account without further notice.

            Superkicks Content, any collection and use of product listings,
            description, or prices, and, any derivative use of the Platforms or

            Platforms including graphics, illustrations, photographs, images,
            videos, charts, screenshots, infographics and other visual aids.
            While reasonable efforts are made to provide accurate visual
            representations, Superkicks disclaims any guarantee or warranty of
            exactness of such visual representation or description of the
            Product, with the actual Product ultimately delivered to Users. The
            appearance of the Product when delivered may vary for various
            reasons.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>2.6.</b> Users may make purchases on the Platforms. For the
            purposes of identifying a User, Superkicks may, from time to time,
            collect certain personally identifiable information such as your
            first name and last name, email address, mobile phone number, postal
            address, other contact information, demographic profile, etc. Users
            may also register themselves on the Platforms. Registration on the
            Platforms is one-time and you are required to remember your username
            and password and keep the same confidential. In the event where you
            have misplaced your username and password details, you can retrieve
            and change the same using the “forgot username/ password” option on
            the Platforms.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>2.7.</b> The User shall assume all risks, liabilities, and
            consequences if his/ her account has been accessed illegally or
            without authorisation through means such as hacking and if through
            such unauthorised access, a purchase of Products has been made
            through the Services. It is specifically clarified that payments of
            monies towards any Products purchased through the Services by
            unauthorised or illegal use of the User’s account shall entirely be
            borne by the User.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>2.8.</b> Display of Products for purchase on the Platforms is
            merely an invitation to offer. An order placed by a User for
            purchase of a Product constitutes an offer. All orders placed by
            Users on the Platforms are subject to the availability of such
            Product, Superkicks’s acceptance of the User’s offer and the User’s
            continued adherence to the terms of the Agreement.
            <br />

            If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not
            current, incomplete, or if Superkicks has reasonable grounds to
            suspect that the information provided by you is untrue, inaccurate,
            not current, incomplete, or not in accordance with the terms of the
            Agreement, Superkicks reserves the right to indefinitely suspend,
            terminate or block your access to the Platforms, and refuse to
            provide you with access to the Platforms in future.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>2.10.</b> All rights and liabilities of Superkicks with respect
            to any Services to be provided by it shall be restricted to the
            scope of the Agreement. In addition to the Agreement, you shall also
            ensure that you are in compliance with the terms and conditions of
            the third parties, whose links are contained/embedded in the
            Services. It is hereby clarified that Superkicks shall not be held
            liable for any transaction between you and any such third parties.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>2.11.</b> You understand that on your registration as a User or
            on your purchase of Products on the Platforms, you may receive text
            messages and/or emails from Superkicks on your registered mobile
            number and/or email address. These messages and/or emails could
            relate inter alia to your registration, Superkicks’s acceptance or
            rejection of your offer to purchase a Product, payment information,
            Product despatch information, information pertaining to other
            activities you carry out on the Platforms and information pertaining
            to the promotions that are undertaken by Superkicks (or third
            parties in connection with the Platforms) from time to time. It is
            specifically clarified that a text message and/or an email
            confirming the receipt of your order is not an acceptance from
            Superkicks that the Product will be delivered. Superkicks’s
            acceptance to your offer to purchase shall occur and conclude only
            when the Products have been despatched by Superkicks and a text
            message and/or email confirming such despatch has been sent to you.
            Superkicks, at all times, reserves the right to limit the quantity
            of items in, or cancel an order prior to despatch.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>2.12.</b> Any communication from Superkicks shall be sent only to
            your registered mobile number and/or email address or such other
            contact number or email address that you may designate, for any
            particular transaction. You shall be solely responsible to update
            your registered mobile number and/or email address on the Platforms
            in the event there is a change. Further, Superkicks may also send
            you notifications and reminders with respect to scheduled deliveries
            of the purchased Products. While Superkicks shall make every
            endeavour to share prompt reminders and notifications relating to
            the delivery of purchased Products with you, Superkicks shall not be
            held liable for any failure to send such notifications or reminders
            to you.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>2.13.</b> Superkicks may, at any time and without having to
            service any prior notice to you: (i) upgrade, update, change,
            modify, or improve the Services or a part of the Services in a
            manner it may deem fit, and (ii) change the contents of the
            Agreement in substance, or as to procedure or otherwise; in each
            case which will be applicable to all Users. You hereby agree that
            this is in the fairness of things given the nature of the business
            and its operations and you will abide by them. As such, you must
            keep yourself updated at all times and review the terms of the
            Agreement from time to time. Such changes shall be made applicable
            when they are posted. Superkicks may also alter or remove any
            content from the Platforms without notice.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>2.14.</b> While Superkicks shall make reasonable endeavours to
            maintain high standards of security and shall provide the Services
            by using reasonable efforts, Superkicks shall not be liable for any
            interruption that may be caused to your access or use of the
            Services.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>2.15.</b> Access to and registration on the Platforms is free of
            cost. Although unlikely, Superkicks may modify the Fee, Payment and

            Platforms, or for use of any new service introduced by Superkicks
            without serving prior notice on the Users.
